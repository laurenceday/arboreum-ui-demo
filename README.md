# Arboreum Demo

- Front-end code is in /app.
- Back-end code is in /app/src.
- Data structures displayed throughout are in /app/pregenerated.

Current setup is tweaked for AWS hosting rather than launching R project directly.

The data structures used here are generated from /app/src/DemoWorkflow.R - if you want, you can generate your own data structures (i.e. a change in parameters et al), although this is something due for later versions of our demo anyway!
