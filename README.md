# Arboreum Demo

- Front-end code is in /app.
- Back-end code is in /app/src.
- Data structures displayed throughout are in /app/pregenerated.

Current setup is tweaked for AWS hosting rather than launching R project directly.

If you want to generate your own data structures (i.e. a change in parameters et al) let us know, we'll put together a skeleton that generates it for you (although this is something due for later versions of our demo anyway!).
